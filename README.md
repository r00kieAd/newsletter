## Acknowledgments

When tried first, which was almost a year ago, had lot of difficulties maintaining the design given by frontend mentor. With the help of references and retires, was able to complete the project.

Re-coded this project from scratch after a year of practice. Definitely felt confident than last year in terms of binding everything together in a structured and optimized way. Major change is the use of sass and jquery.
